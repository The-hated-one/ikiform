- **Troubleshooting Section**: Common issues and solutions for Polar integration
- **API Reference**: Code examples and SDK usage patterns
- **Security Best Practices**: Token management and data protection guidelines

### üîß Technical Improvements

- **Type Safety**: Fixed TypeScript issues with Polar SDK integration
- **Error Handling**: Improved validation and error messages
- **Environment Validation**: Added checks for required environment variables

## Files Changed

### New Files

- `scripts/create-polar-products.ts` - Automated product creation script
- `docs/polar-integration-setup.md` - Comprehensive setup documentation
- `docs/README.md` - Documentation index
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md` - Change tracking
- `docs/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` - This template

### Modified Files

- `package.json` - Added `polar:setup` script
- `src/components/home/pricing/client.tsx` - Updated product IDs and names

## Testing

### ‚úÖ Manual Testing Completed

- [x] Script runs successfully with valid environment variables
- [x] Products created correctly in Polar dashboard
- [x] Product IDs updated in codebase
- [x] Documentation is clear and comprehensive
- [x] Error handling works for missing environment variables

### üß™ Test Scenarios

1. **Valid Setup**: Script creates all 3 products successfully
2. **Missing Token**: Script shows clear error message
3. **Missing Organization ID**: Script shows clear error message
4. **Product Creation**: All products have correct pricing and intervals

## Environment Variables Required

```env
POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_polar_access_token_here
POLAR_ORGANIZATION_ID=your_organization_id_here
```

## Polar Scopes Required

- `products:write` - Create and manage products
- `products:read` - Read product information
- `customers:read` - Read customer information
- `customers:write` - Create and update customers
- `subscriptions:read` - Read subscription information
- `subscriptions:write` - Manage subscriptions
- `orders:read` - Read order information
- `webhooks:write` - Create and manage webhooks

## Usage

### Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Set up environment variables
echo "POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_token" >> .env.local
echo "POLAR_ORGANIZATION_ID=your_org_id" >> .env.local

# 2. Run the setup script
pnpm run polar:setup

# 3. Follow the documentation for webhook configuration
```

### Manual Steps After Script

1. Configure webhooks in Polar dashboard
2. Test the checkout flow
3. Verify webhook events are received

## Benefits

### For Developers

- **Faster Setup**: Automated product creation instead of manual configuration
- **Consistent Configuration**: Standardized product structure across environments
- **Better Documentation**: Clear instructions and troubleshooting guides
- **Type Safety**: Improved TypeScript integration with Polar SDK

### For Users

- **Professional Branding**: "Ikiform Pro" sounds more professional than "Premium"
- **Clear Pricing**: Well-structured product tiers with transparent pricing
- **Reliable Integration**: Robust error handling and validation

## Breaking Changes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Product IDs Updated**: The product IDs in the codebase have been updated to use actual Polar-generated IDs. This is a breaking change that requires updating any hardcoded references.

### Migration Steps

1. Run the setup script to create products
2. Update any hardcoded product ID references
3. Test the checkout flow with new product IDs
